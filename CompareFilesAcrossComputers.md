1. List from each folder on cbfla + list of corrupt files 
2. Compare all portal spreadsheets to contents of cbfla 
    - compare only to cbfla folders that we expect to have records of (not from other herbariums storage folders)
3. List files on LaCie-vasc and LaCie that is half backed up. 
    - can compare later to see if anything on LaCie that not in cloud
