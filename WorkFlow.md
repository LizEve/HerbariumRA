# Imaging Workflow 

1. Turn on camera

2. Wait for EOS to open

3. Check EOS settings
   1. Confirm that `renameimage.exe` is 'registered' to EOS 
      1. Preferences > Linked Software > Register > Browse - select `renameimage.exe`
      2. Full path - `C:Users\Image\Documents\PNWHerbaria\Scripts\renameimage\renameimage.exe`

4. Select portal folder 
   1. In EOS - Preferences > Destination Folder
   2. Select one of the portal folders `C:Users\Image\Desktop\Imaging\`
   3. Personal projects and other special collections that are not going on Symbiota should be imaged in the **Random** folder if you want the images backed up to the server (Sassafrass). Any folders in **Random** will be moved as is to the local backup drive, not sorted into portal folders. 

5. Take photo 
   1. A small box should pop up with the current file name and an place to enter the new name

6. Scan barcode
   1. Barcode should appear as new file name 
   2. Click the "rename" button to rename the file 
   3. The small window will close after the file is renamed. 

Repeat 5. & 6. for all photos

7. Batch edit photos in DPP 

8. Convert from CR2 to JPG
   1. Now you are done, make sure to record on paper what specimens you imaged
